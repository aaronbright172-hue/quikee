              DIY conversion kits and batteries are DIY products, allowing riders to build and customize their own electric bikes. We understand that both experienced and novice users may undertake these projects for fun or learning. However, these are complex electrical systems, and incorrect installation can easily lead to damage or faults.

              By purchasing and installing our products yourself, you acknowledge the inherent risks. Any damage caused by incorrect installation, incorrectly connected, modified, or damaged during setup, the issue will not be considered a manufacturing fault and will not be covered under warranty.
            </p>
            <p className="text-neutral-800 leading-relaxed mt-4">
              We recommend all installations be carried out by a qualified bike technician, electrician, or experienced mechanic to ensure safe operation and to maintain warranty eligibility.

            </h2>
            <p className="text-neutral-800 leading-relaxed">
              We provide complete battery measurements in the product photos, and it is the customer's responsibility to check these measurements against their bike's available frame space before purchasing. It is important to remember that all battery models are a certain size, model, and year. Even if the listed measurements appear similar, differences in frame angle or layout may still prevent the battery from fitting correctly. We have a variety of battery models available with different shapes and sizes. If in doubt, we recommend you opt for one that is smaller than you think you need. Our larger models are quite big.

            <p className="text-neutral-800 leading-relaxed mt-4">
              Bottle cage holder bolts must be removed before installing any battery or battery bag. If these bolts are left in place, they can press against the battery cells, leading to serious damage or fire. We are not responsible for damage due to incorrect battery fitment or damage caused by bottle cage holder bolts.
