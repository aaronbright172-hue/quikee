The SQL script `doc/supabase_schema.sql` has been created.

Please follow these steps to execute the SQL script in your Supabase project:

1.  **Go to your Supabase Project Dashboard.**
2.  **Navigate to the SQL Editor:** In the left sidebar, click on "SQL Editor".
3.  **Create a New Query:** Click the "+ New query" button.
4.  **Paste the SQL Script:** Copy the entire content of `doc/supabase_schema.sql` and paste it into the SQL editor.
5.  **Run the Query:** Click the "Run" button (usually a play icon).

After successfully running the script, you should see the `crypto_payment_settings` and `orders` tables created in your database, along with the `update_timestamp` function, triggers, and RLS policies.

Once you have executed this SQL script and confirmed the tables are created in your Supabase project, please let me know. I will then proceed to the next step, which is setting up the environment variables and creating the backend API routes in Next.js.
